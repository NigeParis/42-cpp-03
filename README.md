Exercise 01: Serena, my love!

Because you can never have enough ClapTraps, you will now create a derived robot. It will be named ScavTrap and will inherit the constructors and destructor from ClapTrap. However, its constructors, destructor, and attack() will print different messages. After all, ClapTraps are aware of their individuality.
Key Points to Remember:

    Ensure ScavTrap inherits ClapTrap's constructors and destructor.

    Override attack() to print specific messages.

    Emphasize individuality in constructors and destructor messages.

Example:
cpp
