# CPP 03 - Inheritance

Welcome to the cpp 03 module! This module dives into the thrilling world of inheritance in C++. Get ready to explore classes and their offspring. Below, you'll find an engaging overview of each exercise to guide you through this adventure.

## Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement a class named `ClapTrap`. This will be the cornerstone of your inheritance journey, so make it sturdy and versatile.

### Key Points to Remember:
- Design and implement constructors and a destructor.
- Define essential attributes like `name`, `hitPoints`, `energyPoints`, and `attackDamage`.
- Add member functions for `attack()`, `takeDamage()`, and `beRepaired()`.

### Example:
```cpp
class ClapTrap {

    public:

        ClapTrap(std::string n) : name(n), hitPoints(100), energyPoints(50), attackDamage(20) {
            std::cout << "ClapTrap " << name << " constructed." << std::endl;
        }

        ~ClapTrap() {
            std::cout << "ClapTrap " << name << " destroyed." << std::endl;
        }

        void attack(const std::string &target) {
            std::cout << "ClapTrap " << name << " attacks " << target << ", causing " << attackDamage << " points of damage!" << std::endl;
        }

        void takeDamage(unsigned int amount) {
            hitPoints -= amount;
            std::cout << "ClapTrap " << name << " takes " << amount << " points of damage!" << std::endl;
        }

        void beRepaired(unsigned int amount) {
            hitPoints += amount;
            std::cout << "ClapTrap " << name << " is repaired for " << amount << " hit points!" << std::endl;
        }

    private:

        std::string name;
        int hitPoints;
        int energyPoints;
        int attackDamage;
};
```


## Exercise 01: Serena, my love!
Time to introduce a new family member! Create a derived robot named `ScavTrap` that inherits from `ClapTrap`. Its constructors, destructor, and `attack()` will have their own unique flair to showcase individuality.

### Example:
```cpp
class ScavTrap : public ClapTrap {

public:
    ScavTrap(std::string n) : ClapTrap(n) {
        std::cout << "ScavTrap " << name << " constructed." << std::endl;
    }
    ~ScavTrap() {
        std::cout << "ScavTrap " << name << " destroyed." << std::endl;
    }

    void attack(const std::string &target) {
        std::cout << "ScavTrap " << name << " fiercely attacks " << target << ", causing " << attackDamage << " points of damage!" << std::endl;
    }

    void ScavTrap::guardGate(void) {
    std::cout << "ScavTrap is now in Gate keeper mode" << std::endl;
    };
};

```


### Key Points to Remember:
- Ensure `ScavTrap` inherits `ClapTrap`'s constructors and destructor.
- Override `attack()` to print distinct and specific messages.
- Highlight individuality in the constructors and destructor messages.

## Exercise 02: Repetitive work
Next up, expand the `ClapTrap` lineage with the `FragTrap` class. This class will inherit from `ClapTrap` and bring its own unique behaviors to the table.

### Example:
```cpp

class FragTrap : public ClapTrap {

public:
    FragTrap(std::string n) : ClapTrap(n) {
        std::cout << "FragTrap " << name << " constructed." << std::endl;
    }
    ~FragTrap() {
        std::cout << "FragTrap " << name << " destroyed." << std::endl;
    }

    void attack(const std::string &target) {
        std::cout << "FragTrap " << name << " powerfully attacks " << target << ", causing " << attackDamage << " points of damage!" << std::endl;
    }

    void FragTrap::highFivesGuys(void) {
        std::cout << "FragTrap " << this->name_ << " Give me five guys ?" << std::endl;
    };
};
```

### Key Points to Remember:
- Implement `FragTrap` with distinctive behavior in its methods.
- Strengthen the inheritance structure.
- Introduce specific functionalities exclusive to `FragTrap`.

## Exercise 03: Now itâ€™s weird!
Get ready for the ultimate challenge: creating a `ClapTrap` that's half `FragTrap`, half `ScavTrap`. Meet `DiamondTrap`, a daring combination that inherits from both `FragTrap` and `ScavTrap`.

### Example:
```cpp
class DiamondTrap : public FragTrap, public ScavTrap {

public:
    DiamondTrap(std::string n) : ClapTrap(n), FragTrap(n), ScavTrap(n), diamondName(n) {
        std::cout << "DiamondTrap " << diamondName << " constructed." << std::endl;
    }
    ~DiamondTrap() {
        std::cout << "DiamondTrap " << diamondName << " destroyed." << std::endl;
    }

    void whoAmI() {
        std::cout << "I am " << diamondName << " also known as " << ClapTrap::name << std::endl;
    }

    void attack(const std::string &target) {
        FragTrap::attack(target);
    }

private:
    std::string name_;
};
```

### Key Points to Remember:
- `DiamondTrap` should inherit constructors and destructors from both `FragTrap` and `ScavTrap`.
- Combine features from both parent classes creatively.
- Ensure it has unique identifiers and methods reflecting its dual heritage.
